# Not a Lizard? Classification App
This app was created using CNN algorithm for image classification/recognition on Streamlit.

#### Video Demo: <>
#### Description:

Found a small, brown, cold-blooded animal and not sure what it might be? You are not alone!
There are people that can't distinguish lizards from newts(tritons). Because these groups of reptiles and amphibians have similar bodytypes with long tails and shorts legs. Newts or other amphibians are associated with water, have soft, slimmy skin and four toes on each front foot. Common lizards are more likely to be found on sunny spots, they are protected by scales all over their body and have five toes, tipped with tiny claws.

You can upload an image of newt or lizard and receive prediction.

#### Creating virtual environment and installing dependencies
I am working on Macbook Pro M1 chip. Here some tips on preparations if you are interested:

1. Download and install Homebrew from https://brew.sh. Follow the steps it prompts you to go through after installation.
2. Download Miniforge3 (Conda installer) for macOS arm64 chips (M1, M1 Pro, M1 Max).
3. Install Miniforge3 into home directory.
```
chmod +x ~/Downloads/Miniforge3-MacOSX-arm64.sh sh ~/Downloads/Miniforge3-MacOSX-arm64.sh 
source ~/miniforge3/bin/activate
```
